Tired of using whips but want to still be able to tell your minions to target something?

Questioning why the squishiest class must use a ranged melee style weapon?

Want to make the summoner class feel more american?

Well this mod might be for you!

<h1>Purpose</h1>

I disliked the route the devs took with the whips. With the summoner having the lowest base armor compared to other classes, 
it doesn't make sense for them to have to play like a melee character. The lack of range with whips limits your ability to distance yourself from a boss.
Mages and Gunslingers are given more armor and do not have such limitations. Paired with the poor summon targetting AI, you must continously engage in short range fights.

I decided to add several new weapons which are designed to be upgraded and scale with you as you play the game. 
They all function similarly to the Space Gun but deal summoner damage and some even apply debuffs.
They also provide you with a good source on continous dps since summon performance can be iffy.

<h2>Current Features</h2>

- This mod adds 7 new summoner weapons which are ranged alternatives to whips meant to be upgraded throughout your playthough. 

<h2>Future Updates</h2>

- Actual Balancing.

- Expansion for Calamity progression.

- Better Sprites.

You can contact me on discord (@Wah#9928) if you have any recommendations for balancing or new items.

Also contact me if you are interested in being commissioned to create better sprites for me :)
